* Menu Configuration:

The docs Layout menu (https://47deg.github.io/sbt-microsites/docs/layouts.html) configuration, now it's slightly different respect to version `0.2.x`. In the previous version, it wasn't necessary to specify the docs folder where the different documents were placed.

For instance:

```
options:
  - title: Getting Started
    url: index.html
    section: intro

  - title: Configuring the Microsite
    url: settings.html
```

Internally the plugin considered that the links above were relative to the `micrositeDocumentationUrl` setting.

However, in the new version: `0.3.0`, you have to specify the inner folder in every case. For example:

```
options:
  - title: Getting Started
    url: docs/index.html
    section: intro

  - title: Configuring the Microsite
    url: docs/settings.html
```

In summary, now all the links are relative to the site base URL.

* Ability to create complex menus like this:

```
  - title: Type Classes
    url: typeclasses.html
    menu_type: typeclasses
    menu_section: typeclasses
```

`section` has been replaced by `menu_section`.

In addition, a new field `menu_type` property has been included in order to define different menus inside the `menu.yml` file.
