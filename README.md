# sbt-microsites

**sbt-microsites** is an SBT plugin that facilitates the creation of fancy microsites for your projects, with minimal tweaks.

## What is a microsite?

A microsite is an instance of Jekyll, ready to publish a static web page for your new library. Some of the benefits of having these auto-generated web pages are:

- You can write documentation easily in markdown format.
- Templates, layouts, styles, and other resources will be able through the plugin at compile time.
- You don't have to deal with the styling.

# Installation

To Begin, add the following lines to the `project/plugins.sbt` file within your project or sbt module where you want to use the `sbt-microsites` plugin.

```
addSbtPlugin("com.fortysevendeg"  % "sbt-microsites" % "0.3.0")
```

Finally, to enable the plugin, add this to your `build.sbt` file:
```
enablePlugins(MicrositesPlugin)
```

We recommend taking a look at the `Getting Started` section at the [documentation](https://47deg.github.io/sbt-microsites/docs/) since there are some prerequisites that are needed to build your microsite.

#Â Documentation

Microsites comes with a range of options to customize and configure your project's site. Please visit the [documentation](https://47deg.github.io/sbt-microsites/docs/) section for more information.

# Kazari plugin

If you already have some pre-existing documentation for your project, `sbt-microsites` also provides a Javascript plugin called [Kazari](KAZARI_PLUGIN.md) that decorates your code snippets with functionality that allows users to edit them live and run them in a remote Scala evaluator; making the learning process a whole lot easier.
